# Repository Isolation Issue - Still Working On It

## üîç **Current Status: INVESTIGATING**

The repository isolation issue is more complex than initially thought. Here's what I've discovered:

### ‚úÖ **What's Working:**
- Repository class correctly accepts custom data paths
- FileHandler class supports different data directories
- Individual repository creation works correctly
- Repository-specific data folders are created properly

### ‚ùå **What's Still Broken:**
- System automatically loads some repository at startup (unknown source)
- Repository switching may not be working properly
- System shows repository names that don't match the repositories.txt file
- Files don't change when switching repositories

### üîç **Investigation Findings:**
1. **Repository Structure**: Each repository correctly has its own `repos/{name}/data/` folder
2. **Global Data Removed**: Deleted the global `data/` folder to force repository-specific usage
3. **Automatic Loading**: System somehow automatically loads a repository at startup
4. **Mystery Repository Names**: Shows repository names that don't exist in repositories.txt

### üõ†Ô∏è **Next Steps:**
1. Find the source of automatic repository loading
2. Ensure repository switching actually changes the active repository
3. Verify that file operations use the correct repository path
4. Test repository isolation thoroughly

### üéØ **Expected Behavior:**
- System should start with NO repository selected
- User should manually create or select a repository
- Each repository should have completely separate files and commits
- Switching repositories should show different files

## üöß **Work in Progress**

The repository isolation feature is still being debugged. The core infrastructure is in place, but there's some automatic repository loading happening that needs to be identified and fixed.
